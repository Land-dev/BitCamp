# Week 1: Setting Up

This week will focus on three topics: learning how to use Git Bash and Github, creating databases, and accessing databses.

### ðŸ“š Summary
Week one will be focusing on the fundamentals that you'll need to use throughout the program in order to create an app effectively.
This will be a relatively light week in terms of courseload.

### Learning Objectives
Git Bash and Github - Learn how to use Git Bash and commit code to repositories, clone repositories, and create branches for cooperative work.
Creating and Accessing MongoDB Databases - Learn how to use MongoDB to create databases, and figure out the interface needed to access various parts of a database.
IDEs - You might already have an IDE, but if not you will need to download one such as VScode. We will be making a Javascript app as part of the course, so if you want to follow along you will want to get an IDE that supports Javascript.

### Livestream
...
- For the full video, look in the [video folder]().
- For the full code, look in the [code folder]().

We'll be going over how to:
- Use Github and Git Bash
- Create and Access MongoDB Databases
- Download IDEs
- Think of a project idea

### Homework
- Create a github repository that will store your project and HW
- Create and Access a MongoDB Database populated with sample data
- Think of a project idea

### :question: How will this help students?
Without these tools, you won't be able to make an app of any kind, so it is essential that you learn these fundamentals.
